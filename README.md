# Introduction
This was a basic bank app, subsequently, I added advanced features like shared_preferences and figured out how to prevent repeated logins by saving login information in shared preferences.

# Feature List
- single-time login If you don't remove your app's cache or log out, there's no need to log in again.
- Account information.

# Developed Using
- Flutter
# Package
- shared_preferences
